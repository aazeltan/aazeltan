## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I’m a data-focused student interested in using **AI and data science to solve real-world problems**.  
Right now, I’m exploring:

- 🧠 **Machine learning & AI** – building models that are practical, not just theoretical  
- 📊 **Data analysis** – turning messy data into insights and stories  
- 🌏 **Social impact** – using tech in areas like education, access, and equity  

In the past, I’ve worked on projects involving:

- Recently built projects in **NLP**, **predictive modeling for stock prices**, and data storytelling.
- I enjoy creating impact-focused tools that help people make better decisions or understand complex information more easily.

Outside of tech, I care a lot about **democratizing access to opportunities** and making complex systems easier for people to navigate.
